# Contributing Guide

Developer and maintainer steps to install, configure, and run rsmetacheck-bot.

## What the bot does

- Run pitfalls detection using [RSMetaCheck package](https://github.com/SoftwareUnderstanding/RsMetaCheck)
- Handle analysis for multiple repositories
- Create repository centric output subfolders

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10, 3.11, or 3.12
- Git (``git`` executable available on ``PATH``)
- GitHub or GitLab personal access token with permission to create issues
- Optional: [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv) (recommended)

Git is a system dependency used for repository commit lookup
(``git ls-remote`` fallback) and is not installed through ``pyproject.toml``.

## Configure authentication

Export your tokens (only set what you need):

```bash
export GITHUB_API_TOKEN=ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxx      # GitHub.com
export GITLAB_API_TOKEN=glpat_xxxxxxxxxxxx    # GitLab.com
```

Convenient one-liner to load a `.env` file:

```bash
set -a; source .env; set +a
```

Example `.env`:

```bash
GITHUB_API_TOKEN=ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxx
GITLAB_API_TOKEN=glpat_xxxxxxxxxxxx
```

## Run complete pipeline

### Create configuration file

The pipeline now uses a single configuration file as its source of truth for:

- repository list `"repositories"`
- custom issue message `"custom_message"`
- inline opt-outs `"opt_outs"`
- output root `"root_dir"`
- run name `"run_name"`
- default snapshot-tag format `"snapshot_tag_format"`

Example config:

```json
{
  "repositories": [
    "https://github.com/SoftwareUnderstanding/rsmetacheck-bot",
    "https://github.com/SoftwareUnderstanding/RsMetaCheck"
  ],
  "issues": {
    "custom_message": "This is a issue created for testing purposes. Several metadata issues were identified and could be addressed.",
    "opt_outs": [
    ]
  },
  "outputs": {
    "root_dir": "assets",
    "run_name": "example_run",
    "snapshot_tag_format": "%Y%m%d"
  }
}
```

`opt-out` lists the repositories for which issues won't be submitted but the repository is still analysed and part of the result outputs.

### Run analysis

To run the bot, start with analysis.

```bash
uv run rsmetacheck-bot run-analysis \
  --config-file assets/ossr_list_url.json
```

You can override the generated snapshot tag when needed.

```bash
uv run rsmetacheck-bot run-analysis \
  --config-file <path_to_your_config.json> \
  --snapshot-tag <example_suffix>
```

Output structure using the example config file provided:

```text
assets/
└── example_run/
  └── <snapshot_tag>/
    ├── analysis_results.json
    ├── config.json
    ├── run_report.json
    ├── github_com_softwareunderstanding_rsmetacheck_bot/
    │   ├── issue_report.md
    │   ├── pitfall.jsonld
    │   ├── report.json
    │   └── somef_output.json
    └── github_com_softwareunderstanding_rsmetacheck/
      ├── issue_report.md
      ├── pitfall.jsonld
      ├── report.json
      └── somef_output.json
```

- `assets/`: output root selected by `"root_dir": "assets"` in the config.
- `example_run/`: run namespace selected by `"run_name": "example_run"`; this keeps outputs from different campaigns separated.
- `<snapshot_tag>/`: one analysis snapshot folder, usually generated from `"snapshot_tag_format": "%Y%m%d"` unless you override it with `--snapshot-tag`.
- `analysis_results.json`: global analysis summary for the full run, including the repositories that were evaluated and metadata such as commit identifiers.
- `config.json`: a copy of the effective configuration used for this snapshot, stored for reproducibility.
- `run_report.json`: top-level decision report for the whole batch, with counters and one record per repository.
- `github_com_softwareunderstanding_rsmetacheck_bot/`: per-repository folder for `https://github.com/SoftwareUnderstanding/rsmetacheck-bot`; repository URLs are sanitized to lowercase folder names.
- `github_com_softwareunderstanding_rsmetacheck/`: per-repository folder for `https://github.com/SoftwareUnderstanding/RsMetaCheck`; it contains the same artifact set as the other repository folder.
- `issue_report.md`: human-readable markdown report that can be reviewed before publication and reused as issue content.
- `pitfall.jsonld`: raw RSMetacheck JSON-LD output for the repository, including detected checks and evidence.
- `report.json`: machine-readable per-repository report summarizing findings, action/decision, identifiers, and links to generated artifacts.
- `somef_output.json`: raw SOMEF metadata extraction output used as input for the analysis pipeline.

The exact repository folder names depend on the repository URLs in your config, but the files created inside each repository folder follow this same pattern.

### Publish

If you want to submit the analysis to the actual repositories, you can publish from an existing analysis snapshot (no new analysis is generated):

```bash
uv run rsmetacheck-bot publish \
  --analysis-root outputs/ossr/<snapshot_tag>
```

This requires setting up environment variables `GITHUB_API_TOKEN` / `GITLAB_API_TOKEN` with working tokens.
We recommend creating a `.env` file.
You can use the `uv run rsmetacheck-bot verify-tokens` command to test them after set up.

## Troubleshooting

- **Auth failed / 401**: Check `GITHUB_API_TOKEN` / `GITLAB_API_TOKEN` are exported and valid.
- **403 / 404 on issue creation**: You need write/triage permissions on the repository. Test with repos you own first.
- **Platform not supported**: Repo must be GitHub or GitLab (self-hosted GitLab is auto-detected).
- **Review before posting**: Inspect snapshot reports after `run-analysis`, then run `publish` on the selected analysis root.
- **Publish failed because of transient API issues**: Fix the cause (for example wait for rate-limit reset or refresh token), then rerun publish with retry mode:

```bash
uv run rsmetacheck-bot publish \
  --analysis-root outputs/ossr/<snapshot_tag> \
  --retry-failed
```

Already posted records remain skipped for idempotency; retry mode only re-attempts eligible failed records.

## CI test policy

The CI intentionally separates deterministic unit tests from real GitLab integration tests:

- Unit tests are always blocking and run on every PR/push.
- GitLab integration tests are conditional and run only on `main`, scheduled runs, or manual dispatch.
- Integration tests require `GITLAB_API_TOKEN` to be configured in GitHub repository secrets.

This keeps contributor PRs stable while still validating live GitLab API behavior regularly.

### Run tests locally

Run default (unit) suite:

```bash
uv run pytest -m "not integration_gitlab"
```

Run GitLab integration tests (requires token):

```bash
export GITLAB_API_TOKEN=glpat_xxxxxxxxxxxx
uv run pytest --run-integration-gitlab -m "integration_gitlab"
```

## Supported platforms

- GitHub.com
- Gitlab.com

Self-hosted GitLab instances are supported when you provide a token for the target host (not been tested yet).
Run the bot against your own organization or repositories where you have permission to open and manage issues.
