## 🛠️ For Maintainers Running This Bot

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for setup and usage instructions.

Project storage policy: the repo-centric layout and migration rules are described in [docs/output_storage.rst](docs/output_storage.rst).

The pipeline is config driven: one JSON file defines the repository list, issue message, inline opt-outs, and output layout.

Supported platforms:

- ✅ GitHub.com
- ✅ Gitlab.com

The bot is handling self-hosted gitlab platform but requires providing a token to this server (and not gitlab.com).

### Safe workflow for local validation

Use these commands when validating the bot without creating live issues:

1. Legacy snapshot conversion

```bash
uv run rsmetacheck-bot convert-legacy outputs/legacy_snapshot --target-root outputs/converted
```

This converts a legacy snapshot tree into the current repo-centric layout without publishing anything.

2. Fresh dry-run analysis from scratch

```bash
uv run rsmetacheck-bot run-analysis --config-file config.json --snapshot-tag 202603
```

This writes analysis outputs and run reports, but remains dry-run and does not create issues.

3. Simulated publish review

```bash
uv run rsmetacheck-bot simulate-publish --analysis-root outputs/batch-a/202603
```

This replays the analysis decisions with a fake issue client so you can review the generated issue bodies and opt-out logic without spamming real repositories.

> Avoid the live `publish` command unless you explicitly want to create or update real repository issues.
